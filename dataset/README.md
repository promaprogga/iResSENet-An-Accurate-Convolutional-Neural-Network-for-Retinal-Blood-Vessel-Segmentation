Download the Retinal datasets and their masks: DRIVE ([Link](https://drive.grand-challenge.org/)), CHASE_DB1 ([Link](https://blogs.kingston.ac.uk/retinal/chasedb1/)), HRF ([Link](https://www5.cs.fau.de/research/data/fundus-images/)) and STARE ([Link](https://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/stare/)). 




*Note: Masks should be downloded from Valentina Kouznetsova's hand labeled vessels in STARE dataset. Here is the [Link](https://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/stare/probing/index.html).
